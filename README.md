# **The Jailbreak Archive**
Some Jailbreak files I have collected over time.

You could use these some of these place files to re-script the game (And have your own Jailbreak, how amazing does that sound!)

# **Contents**

This repository's contents are divided in three different folders: saveinstances, remakes & rescripts. These are also organized by year for ease of access.

### **Saveinstances (And features)**

# **File Suggestions**
File suggestions are welcome. Just create an issue including your file, and I'll verify if it's a legit map, if so, I will make sure to include it in here! (and of course, credit you).
