# **The Jailbreak Archive**
These are some Jailbreak saveinstances I have collected over time.

You could use these some of these place files to re-script the game (And have your own Jailbreak, how amazing does that sound!)

# **Contents**

This repository's contents are divided in three different folders: saveinstances, remakes & rescripts. These are also organized by year for ease of access.

# **For File Suggestions**
Create an issue including your file, and I'll verify if it's a real map, if so, I will make sure to include it in here!
